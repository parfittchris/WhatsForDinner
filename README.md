# whatsfordinner - Takes the thinking out of meal planning

## Background and Overview
whatsfordinner is a recipe finding tool that takes the decision-making out of choosing what to cook by finding published recipes based on inputed ingredients.

Users can enter ingredients they have on hand into the web interface, press the 'submit' button and the app will identify recipes that contain all the ingredients the user added. The results are shown in a dendrogram showing the ingredients listed, ingredients still needed to complete the recipe, and the final recipe in different tiers. Additionally, users are able to click on the final recipes and be sent to the location where that recipe exists with instructions.

## Functionality & MVP 
In whatsfordinner, users will be able to:
  * Input ingredients into a form
  * Press submit button and have app find recipes matching input ingredients
  * Click on resulting recipes and be redirected to locations those recipes exist
  * Click on listed ingredients not originally inputed to add them to their collection and thereby update overall results
  
In addition, this project will include:
  * A modal explaining the functionality of the app
  
## Wireframes

The app will consist of a single screen consisting of the main area that will show the resulting dendrogram, as well as a side bar featuring a form where the users can input up to 5 ingredients. In addition, the sidebar will contain a submit button to begin the recipe search process, an about button that will render a modal with information about the app, and links to my Github and LinkedIn profiles.
